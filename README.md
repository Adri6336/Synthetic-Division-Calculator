# Synthetic-Division-Calculator
An old program I wrote around June 2020. I figured I might as well upload it as I may try to 
make it a python GUI program in the future. It is not pretty, it doesn't even clear the 
console when restarting, but it gets the job done. 

# Steps:
1. Download the only executable file in this repository
2. Double click the executable file to run it
3. Profit?
